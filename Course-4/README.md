# JavaScript all essentials

## Module 4 Summary: JavaScript Async
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight, human-readable, and machine-readable data interchange format.

JSON utilizes key-value pairs and arrays, providing simplicity for both developers and non-developers.

AJAX, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, revolutionizes web development by facilitating dynamic and responsive applications.

Advantages of using AJAX include enhanced user interfaces, reduced server load, and uninterrupted user interactions.

Common uses range from dynamic content loading to real-time updates and auto-saving features in social media and e-commerce platforms.

XMLHttpRequest or XHR is a JavaScript API facilitating communication between web browsers and servers.

XMLHttpRequest enables asynchronous HTTP requests, allowing data retrieval or submission without reloading the entire webpage.

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments, executed later or after specific events.

Promises offer a powerful way to handle asynchronous operations.

You can create promises using the promise constructor, taking resolve and reject functions.

The fetch API is a modern JavaScript interface that offers a flexible and powerful approach to fetching resources from the web.

The fetch API supports various HTTP request methods, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and OPTIONS.

Axios offers a clean and consistent API for asynchronous interactions with RESTful APIs or web services.

Axios streamlines the process of making HTTP requests, providing a user-friendly interface and additional features that enhance the overall development experience compared to native solutions like Fetch.
